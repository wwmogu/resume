    <h2>Mistakes</h2>
        <p>
            Years ago, I had a fixed mindset. 
            However, I realized that a growth mindset is how we really grow. 
            So, I want to share my mistakes, not just the blooming success but the actual things that made me successful. 
            (Fun fact: This is actually one of my mistakes.)
